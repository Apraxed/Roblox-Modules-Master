# Roblox Development Free Modules

Here are some modules my team and I created for public use.

*Most* modules do not require you to download any Roblox `.rbxm` file

Note: All scripts are slightly modified from the Roblox main code due to GitHub restrictions

If you have any issues with these scripts, please [add them to the issues tracker!](https://github.com/Apraxed/Roblox-Modules-Master/issues/) I get a notification any time an issue is added or a pull request is added. Feel free to use pull requests too!

If you need help with scripting, join [CodeCafe](https://discord.gg/SwGyxj4Hc4), a roblox scripting help Discord Server run by my good friend Luke! Tell him I sent you.

Note: I will not be adding support to importing with Rojo
