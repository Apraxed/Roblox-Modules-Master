# Roblox Development Free Modules

Here are some modules my team and I created for public use. 

*Most* modules do not require you to download any Roblox `.rbxm` file

**Note: All scripts are slightly modified from the Roblox main code due to GitHub restrictions

## Note from the Developer

Hiya! I'm Zack. Some 15 y/o nerd who got into Lua*u* (Roblox Lua) scripting. As I've improved I have made some scripts that most people do not understand how to make. If it weren't for the amazing ROBLOX Development Community I wouldn't be here in the first place so I wanted to give back. I have made 2 commonly used yet moderately hard ROBLOX Development modules. (Nametags and Off-Site logging) I should mention that this is a passion project, I make nothing off of this directly.

----

Because I do not directly make anything off of this I am always accepting donations! You can use the link in the GitHub "Sponsor this project" section to see how you can donate to me via crypto currencies or PayPal.

As I release this I want to give some special thanks to the people who have helped me the most during my journey into becoming a ROBLOX Game Developer.
