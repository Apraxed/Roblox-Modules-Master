# Custom Nametags

This is a complete rewrite of my original Custom UsernameGUI script. However due to the extra features I added to this I will keep it seprate. This version is a lot more complicated but you can find the simplified version of it on Roblox [here!](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/14894647458/) or just by downloading the rbxm file!

To use this, make a script with "RunContext" set to legacy, then go in and paste the handler script into it. You can edit the settings in the top where it defines "Settings"
