NOTES:
- Discord has stated that Roblox-based webhooks are against their Terms of Service. If you want to take the risk you may use a proxy like https://hooks.hyra.io in order to get around the Roblox Webhook Block.
	- I (Aprax3d) hearby take no responsibility for any actions against your Discord or Roblox Accounts for using this model.
- Guilded is the best for logging as Roblox-based json webhooks aren't against their Terms of Service.
