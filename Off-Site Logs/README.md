NOTES:

- Discord has stated that Roblox-based webhooks are against their Terms of Service. If you want to take the risk you have use a proxy (like <https://webhook.lewisakura.moe>) in order to get around the Roblox Webhook Block.
  - I (@Apraxed) hearby take no responsibility for any actions against your Discord or Roblox Accounts for using this module. The information above for use of Discord webhooks is purely educational
- Guilded is the best for logging as Roblox-based json webhooks aren't against their Terms of Service (Guilded is owned by Roblox Corp so they have no issues with you using their own software).
- Chatlogs have been removed as legally I am in the clear to show them for educational purposes but I consider myself partially responsible if anyone got banned

Special Thanks:

- Vrkias_Yarlen --- Being an amazing development partner and letting me focus on scripting instead of everything
